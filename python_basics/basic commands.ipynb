    "\n",
    "- Open source and large active community base: Python is open source, and it has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support.\n",
    "- Versatile, easy to read, learn, and write: Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",
    "- Dynamically typed language: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare data types explicitly, making it flexible but still reliable.\n",
    "- Object-Oriented and Procedural programming language: Python supports both object-oriented and procedural programming, providing versatility in coding styles.\n",
    "- Portable and interactive: Python is portable across operating systems and interactive, allowing real-time code execution and testing."

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than compiled languages like C or Java. This can be an issue for performance-intensive tasks. (The primary difference is how code is translated into machine instructions: a compiled language is translated entirely into an executable file before it runs, while an interpreted language is translated and executed line by line at runtime - https://dev.to/gridou/interpreted-vs-compiled-languages-understanding-the-difference-4ak8#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20Interpreted%20Language,directly%20executed%20by%20an%20interpreter.)\n",
    "- Global Interpreter Lock: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism in Python that prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at once. This can limit the parallelism and concurrency of some applications. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/what-is-the-python-global-interpreter-lock-gil/\n",
    "- Dynamically typed: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the types of variables can change at runtime. This can make it more difficult to catch errors and can lead to bugs.\n",
    "- Packaging and versioning: Python has a large number of packages and libraries, which can sometimes lead to versioning issues and package conflicts.\n",
    "- Lack of strictness: Python's flexibility can sometimes be a double-edged sword. While it can be great for rapid development and prototyping, it can also lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain"
